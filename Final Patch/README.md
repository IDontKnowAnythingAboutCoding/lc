##Third Tidal Cycles Patch Documentation

David Gao

This livecoding patch features 808 drums, acid bassline, an arpeggiated melody and textures. It also has modulated cutoff filter creating sonic variations and livecoding possibilities. The melody uses an arpeggiated sequence with modulated pan as well as a room reverb adding spatial movement and harmonic interest. The texture layer introduces a percussive noise element with modulations. Each layer is isolated, allowing real-time parameter changes.
